   <h2>Description</h2>
   Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks. I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night. The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce 
   (text from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22469/barbecue-ribs/" target="_blank">Allrecipes</a>).
